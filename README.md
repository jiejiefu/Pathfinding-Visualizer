# Pathfinding and Maze Generation Visualizer

A Graphical User Interface built web app using React Framework to visiualize different pathfinding and maze generation algorithms.

Check out the visualizer in action here.

## Sample (A* Algorithm with Recursive Division Maze):

</p>

## Pathfinding Algorithms:
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. A* Algorithm
3. Greedy Best First Search
4. Bidirectional Greedy Search
5. Breadth First Search
6. Depth First Search
7. Random Walk

## Maze Generation Algorithms:
1. Random Maze
2. Recursive Division Maze
3. Vertical Division Maze
4. Horizontal Division Maze

## To Be Implemented
- Stop/Resume Button to pause the animation
- Path animation that interacts with walls while searching
- Random walk animation needed to readjust
- Adding weighted nodes on grids
- If there is no path, try to break minimum walls itself
- Once found a path, still show a path immediately while moving the starting point
- Implement more [maze generation algorithms](https://github.com/jaalsh/java-maze-algorithms).


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Thank you

The app is inspired from [Clément Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu) project.
